**SCADA Data Logger — Java + MySQL Project**

This project is a real-time data logging system for power distribution monitoring, inspired by my summer internship at SCADA Bhawan, Patna under SBPDCL (South Bihar Power Distribution Company Limited). It is developed using Java (JDBC) and MySQL, and simulates logging of substation data like voltage, frequency, current load, power factor, and energy supplied.

**Technologies Used**

Java (JDK 17+)

MySQL

JDBC (MySQL Connector/J)

VS Code

MySQL Workbench




**Features**

✅ Add new power device records (substation-wise)

✅ View all logged records in tabular format

✅ Update status and remarks by ID

✅ Delete records by ID

✅ Real-time timestamp logging

✅ Clean and interactive CLI interface


**📌 Learning Outcomes**

Practical experience with JDBC and relational databases

Understanding of power distribution system logging

Clean implementation of CRUD operations

Structured project documentation for real-world use
